This project aims to create a minimal, user-friendly website tailored for older Norwegian users. The site will help users determine the correct wall adapter needed for different countries—with a focus on Norway initially—and include high-quality images as well as affiliate links to local online shops.

## Overview

The website will:
- Provide clear and accessible information on wall adapters, starting with Norway.
- Feature large, readable text and a simple navigation design.
- Include images of each adapter with proper alt text.
- Contain affiliate links to local online shops for purchasing the adapters.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the website structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling and ensuring accessibility (large fonts, high contrast, simple layout).
- **JavaScript:** For any necessary interactivity (e.g., dynamic content loading or navigation enhancements).
- **Optional:** A Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress for ease of updates, if preferred later.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Project Directory:**  
   Create a new directory for the project.
   ```bash
   mkdir travel_adapter_finder
   cd travel_adapter_finder
   ```

2. **Version Control:**  
   Initialize a Git repository.
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Development Environment:**  
   - Install a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
   - Optionally, install a local web server (e.g., using the Live Server extension in VS Code).

## Development Steps

### Project Structure

Organize your files as follows:

```
travel_adapter_finder/
├── index.html
├── adapters/
│   └── norway.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── images/
    └── [adapter images...]
```

### HTML Development

- **index.html:**  
  - Create a homepage that introduces the website.
  - Include navigation to the adapter pages.
  
- **adapters/norway.html:**  
  - Create a dedicated page for Norwegian wall adapters.
  - Add clear descriptions, images (with appropriate alt text), and sections for affiliate links.
  
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Ensure all images include descriptive alt text.
  - Use semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.

### CSS Development

- **style.css:**  
  - Develop a simple, minimal design using large fonts and high-contrast color schemes.
  - Keep the layout uncluttered with ample spacing for ease of navigation.
  - Consider using CSS media queries to ensure responsiveness across devices.

### JavaScript Development

- **main.js (if needed):**  
  - Add any interactive elements, such as smooth scrolling or dynamic content loading.
  - Ensure any JavaScript enhances accessibility rather than hindering it.
  
### Affiliate Integration

- **Identify Affiliate Partners:**  
  - Research local online shops that sell wall adapters and join their affiliate programs.
  
- **Embed Affiliate Links:**  
  - In your HTML, include affiliate links within product descriptions or image captions.
  - Optionally, maintain a separate JavaScript or JSON file to manage affiliate URLs for easy updating.

## Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing:**  
   - Test the website across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Validate HTML and CSS using online validators (e.g., W3C Validator).

2. **Deployment:**  
   - Choose a hosting platform. Options include:
     - **GitHub Pages:** For a free static site.
     - **Netlify:** For easy continuous deployment.
     - **Traditional hosting providers:** If more control is needed.
   - Follow the chosen platform's deployment guide to push your site live.

## Maintenance and Future Enhancements

- **Content Expansion:**  
  - Once the Norwegian site is stable, consider adding additional country pages.
  
- **User Feedback:**  
  - In the future, integrate a feedback system or simple user reviews.
  
- **Analytics:**  
  - Add analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to monitor site traffic and affiliate link clicks.
  
- **CMS Integration:**  
  - If content updates become frequent, consider migrating to a CMS like WordPress for easier management.
